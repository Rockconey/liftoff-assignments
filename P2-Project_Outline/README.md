## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is an allergic event tracking application that will allow users to log in and submit information about allergic reactions. It will allow users to track potential triggers, symptoms, ameliorative steps taken, their effect, and upload photos to document visible external symptoms. Users will be able to develop a known allergies list, search events for common factors, and download data to send to physicians.

The idea for this project came from the need to be able to easily document allergic reactions, keep up with known allergens, and effectively communicate with physicians. 

### Features
•	User Login: Users will be able to create accounts and securely log in to access their information and update their profiles. Provider login? All access will be restricted.

•	Create and Edit Allergic Events: Users will be able to create new events in the system by entering required data (date, time, symptoms) and optional fields ( suspected triggers, additional notes, pictures)

•	Search: Users will be able to search allergic events to find common triggers. Users will be able to view a listing of recent events, and by clicking on a recent event view details about that event.

•	Download Event Data: Users will be able to download data to send to a physician.

•	Add to Known Allergy List: Users will be able to add known allergies and reactions to a list for easy access.
